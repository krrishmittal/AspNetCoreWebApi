# 🚀 ASP.NET Core Web API Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository documents my **hands-on learning journey with ASP.NET Core Web API**, where I apply core C# and .NET concepts to build real-world backend applications. This repo represents my transition from C# fundamentals into **professional-grade .NET backend development**.

The focus here is not just writing APIs, but understanding **how production-ready APIs are structured**, how data flows through the system, and how clean architecture principles are applied in real applications.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

After building a strong foundation in **C# and Object-Oriented Programming**, this repository is dedicated to:
- Learning **ASP.NET Core Web API** from the ground up
- Implementing real-world **CRUD operations**
- Working with **Entity Framework Core** and databases
- Applying **clean architecture concepts** such as the Repository Pattern
- Writing maintainable, scalable, and readable backend code

Each folder in this repository represents a **progressive step** in my .NET learning journey.

## 📅 My Daily Learning Progress

Each day represents a focused learning milestone with hands-on implementation.

---

### **Day 1: Getting Started with ASP.NET Core Web API**

Learned how to create my **first ASP.NET Core Web API project** and understand the core building blocks of Web API development.

👉 [View Day 1 Project →](ASPCoreWebAPI)

---

### **Day 2: Web API with Database & CRUD Operations**

Built a complete Web API with **CRUD operations** and connected it to a database using **Entity Framework Core**.

👉 [View Day 2 Project →](ASPCoreWebApiCRUD)

---

### **Day 3: Repository Pattern & Clean Architecture**

Refactored the application using the **Repository Pattern** to separate data access logic and improve code maintainability.

👉 [View Day 3 Project →](RepositoryServices)

---

### **Day 4: Unit of Work Pattern & Transaction Handling**

Implemented **server-side pagination** to efficiently handle large datasets and learned how real-world APIs manage large amounts of data without performance issues.

👉 [View Day 4 Project →](UnitOfWork)

This step helped me understand how larger applications handle database transactions, reduce tight coupling between repositories, and maintain a clean and scalable data access layer. The focus here was on structuring the code the way it is done in **real-world enterprise .NET applications**.


---

### **Day 5: Pagination, Sorting & Filtering in Web API**

Implemented the **Unit of Work pattern** to manage multiple repositories through a single database context and ensure data consistency across operations.

👉 [View Day 5 Project →](pagination)

This step focused on improving API performance by introducing pagination, dynamic sorting, and filtering using query parameters. It helped me understand why production APIs never return all records at once and how scalable backend systems are designed.

---

### **Day 6: Logging with Serilog (Production-Ready APIs)**

Implemented **structured logging** using **Serilog** to make the Web API production-ready and easier to debug, monitor, and maintain.


👉 [View Day 6 Project →](LoggingWithSerilog)

This step focused on understanding **why logging is critical in real-world applications** and how professional .NET applications track requests, errors, and application lifecycle events.


---
### **Day 7: Model Validation & Clean Request Handling**

Implemented **robust validation** in the Web API to ensure only **correct, meaningful, and safe data** enters the system.
